# Capstone-Project

1. Problem Overvew: Within the company, there is a team that is responsible for defining product characteristics that will be built. For a blender category, for example, this team is responsible for setting the color, cup volume, cup material or even if you will have a filter to fruit juice. To define the characteristics of the different product categories, the team seeks to understand when the customer is interested in a product. This is where the Data Science team is called. Your main objective is to develop a model that can classify the product between "interesting" and "not interesting" given the attributes of it. In addition, it is desirable that you can also indicate which attributes and their values drive the customer's interest the most.

2. Problem Statement

Develop a model that can classify the product between "interesting" and "not interesting" given the attributes of it. In addition, it is desirable to indicate which attributes and their values most drive customer interest.

* Explore the database for insights that can guide you through the learning model creation phase.
* Create a machine learning model can classify the product between "interesting" and "not interesting" given the attributes of the product.
* Use metrics to analyze modeling results

3. Required libraries
